# Raul Vargas â€“ Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases selected projects across web, mobile, and graphics development. Each project highlights different areas of my work, from real-time ordering systems and mobile study apps to low-level raytracing engines. The site is currently deployed on Vercel.
